A virtual Classroom with VR interactivity

This project was a hackathon project my friends and I worked on.
Purpose: Enable teachers to teach students through a very fun and interactive classroom through virtual reality.

Our small classroom has one lesson so far: a demonstration that shows students that x direction velocity is completely independent on y direction velocity, and vice versa.

Here is a small demo that visualizes this: https://ludicrous-cadet.glitch.me

Front end: HTML, css, regular javascript (for the physics/physics engine)
NOT shown in this repository is a node.js back-end via socket.io
